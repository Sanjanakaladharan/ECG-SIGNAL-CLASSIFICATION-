while using the feature extraction technique reffered in this paper we will get an error of data is infinte
this is because of the Nan values present in the signals

so  we can remove the Nan values using these lines of code 

LNaN=length(find(isnan(signal)));
    if LNaN>0
       signal(find(isnan(signal)))=0;
    end
    
    
    in the matlab Feature Extraction file in the code given in https://github.com/fernandoandreotti/cinc-challenge2017
    signal is the orginal ECG signal
